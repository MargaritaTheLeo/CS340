Client/Server Development

/* How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future? */

In my coding I use the following practices:

1) Using descriptive and meaningful names for variables and functions.

2) Modularizing the code.

3) Using APIs whenever possible.

4) Keeping imports organized.

5) Following a consistent coding style.

6) Using comments where appropriate.

7) Using blank space effectively.

8) Testing the code thoroughly.

The CRUD module developed for this project is rather multifuntional, and it can be used for a variety of tasks that involve working with databases. This relatively small module will be handy for working with MongoDB for a big number of projects.

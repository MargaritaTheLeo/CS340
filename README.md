Client/Server Development

/* How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future? */

In my coding I use the following practices:

1) Using descriptive and meaningful names for variables and functions.

2) Modularizing the code.

3) Using APIs whenever possible.

4) Keeping imports organized.

5) Following a consistent coding style.

6) Using comments where appropriate.

7) Using blank space effectively.

8) Testing the code thoroughly.

The CRUD module developed for this project is rather multifuntional, and it can be used for a variety of tasks that involve working with databases. This relatively small module will be handy for working with MongoDB for a big number of projects. 

/* How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests? */

As a computer scientist, I so my best to implement the following techniques when solving a problem:

1) Understand exactly what needs to be done. Most tasks are difficult because you don't understand them.
   
2) Don't start solving a problem without a plan, hoping not to get confused by it. Plan your solution. Give your brain time to analyze and process information.

3) Don't try to solve one big problem. Instead, divide it into subtasks. It will be much easier to solve them.

/* What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better? */

Computer scientists are concerned with the theoretical study of computer hardware and software. As a computer scientist, you do not necessarily work with applications and hardware like computer engineers; instead, you apply aspects of technology, such as programming principles, data science, and robotics, to create or improve computer systems and software. In addition, computer scientists master programming languages and numerous computational tools to create algorithms that solve real-world problems.
